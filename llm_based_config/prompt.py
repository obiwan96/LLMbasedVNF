            If you need access to the inside of the VM for internal VM settings, instead of setting floating IP on the created VM,
            use the Jump Host, which can connect to the internal VM, 
            to connect to the newly created VM with SSH. Here is the Jump Host information.
            You will need to enable SSH connection in newly created VM through password to enable connection from Jump Host,
            and you will need to set an ID and password to 'ubuntu'. You should get an IP address in 'server' object and use it to connect in VM.
            Jump Host IP: {JUMP_HOST_IP}, Username: ubuntu, Password: {JUMP_HOST_PWD}
            When if you need to modify some files in VM, Paramiko is not an interactive session, so you should not use vim or nano. I recommend to use echo, but you can find other way.
            Every time you access the VM with Paramiko, it connect to '/home' directory, so 'cd' does not work. I recommend you to use the absolute path.

            prompts_1 = f'''You are an Kubernetes cloud expert. 
            Please write Python code that creates a Kubernetes Pod and installs a VNF inside it, taking the following points into consideration.
            You don't have to explain your code. Keep your answer code-focused and as simple as possible.
            I will provide you with a Method Of Procedure (MOP) that describes the process of installing a Pod in Kubernetes and configuring a VNF on that Pod. 
            Based on this MOP, you must write a single, self-contained Python function with the following strict requirements:
	        1.	The entire logic for creating the Pod and configuring the VNF must be contained within one function only; do not split the logic into multiple functions or files.
	        2.	The function must be named 'create_pod'.
	        3.	The 'create_pod' function must accept exactly three input parameters: 'pod_name', 'namespace', and 'image_name'.
	        4.	The function must return True if the Pod is created and the VNF is configured successfully; otherwise, it must return False.
	        5.	Do not include any additional parameters or helper functions; everything must be implemented inside the create_pod function.
            6.  Don't put any kind of infinity loop in the code.
            7.  The Kubernetes configuration file is in it's default path, '/home/dpnm/.kube/config'. So to load the configuration, use 'load_kube_config' instead of 'load_incluster_config'.
            8.  Don't put usage or example in the code block.
            9.  Instead of using the cluster's default DNS settings, manually set the DNS to '{DNS_IP}'.
            10. Put 'sleep infinity' command, so that container dosen't killed.
            12. Since systemctl cannot be used in containers, even if the MOP instructs to install the VNF using systemctl, an alternative method like running with daemon option, must be found.
            12. Don't use stdin to get any kind of password.
            13. Don't make 'host_name' option as True in Pod creation step.
            14. Configure the VNF in one container.

            Please ensure that you follow these instructions exactly and do not deviate from the specified function name, parameter list, or return value.'''

            prompts_2= f'''1. Kubernetes is already properly installed on a remote server, and the kubeconfig file needed to connect to it is located at the default path. I can access the Kubernetes server from my current (local) server.
            2. Based on this setup, write a YAML code that fully automate the process of creating a Pod and installing a VNF inside it.
            3. Do not write any code that performs direct actions on the local server or inside the Kubernetes Node.
            4. You must keep only the following three values as variables: pod_name, namespace, and image_name, so that they can be passed in separately.
            5. You should keep the pod name, namespace, and image fields as variables, so they can be passed separately. The variable names are 'pod_name', 'namespace', and 'image_name'. Aside from these three, do not use any other variables — all other values should be hardcoded explicitly.
            6. Do not include a vars section in the code, as I will run it using my own variables.
            7. Instead of using the cluster’s default DNS settings, manually set the DNS to {DNS_IP}.
            8. Include the command sleep infinity in the container so that it stays alive and doesn’t get terminated.
            9. Do not set the host_name option to True. 
            10. Keep in mind that systemctl cannot be used inside containers. Even if the MOP instructs installing the VNF using systemctl, you must find an alternative method, such as running it with a daemon option.
            
            The final goal is that I should be able to create the desired Pod simply by providing the values for pod_name, namespace, and image_name, and executing the Ansible playbook you provide without any modifications to the code.
            Write the entire code as a single code block, and do not split it into multiple pieces.
